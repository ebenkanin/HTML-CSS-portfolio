                    Why I made this?

                    <p>
                        The primary motivation for developing this tool is to enhance time efficiency. <br>
                        At Gaba, instructors are not compensated for the 5-minute breaks between lessons. <br>
                        Many instructors, as I've observed, do not complete their lesson comments during these brief. <br>
                       This tool is designed specifically to assist those instructors, facilitating a more streamlined and <br>
                        effective way to handle their tasks without infringing on their unpaid time. <br>
                       The Rationale for Not Writing Comments During Lesson Time
                        Many instructors at Gaba choose not to write lesson comments during the allocated lesson time, and this decision is rooted in strategic and pedagogical considerations. <br>
                        In a highly competitive environment like Gaba, where an instructor's livelihood depends on their popularity, maximising the use of lesson time for teaching rather than <br>
                        administrative tasks can be crucial. <br>
                        Clients often perceive that they receive more value when instructors devote the entire lesson duration to teaching from the textbook, rather than ending the session early <br>
                        to write comments. This perception can influence their preference for certain instructors.<br>

                        Realising this, I adjusted my approach to align with this competitive reality. By not writing lesson comments within the lesson period, <br>
                        I aim to ensure that clients receive the fullest possible benefit from their limited time. This approach also positions me competitively  <br>
                        against other instructors who have already chosen to write comments post-lesson, thereby balancing the need for thorough student feedback with <br>
                        the imperative to remain favoured among clients.
